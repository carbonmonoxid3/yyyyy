We were kids back then and I know you wish we never did what we did, but oh well <br>
I guess you'll live and learn <br>
I'm counting pennies, going to the city<br>
It's good fun, but it sure ain't pretty<br>
We know, we know how to fall (We know how to fall, yeah)<br>
But I'm goin' upstate, for a few days<br>
And you should come, but don't be late<br>
Guess I'm back in my ways, I'm back to your face<br>
I know I shouldn't, but can I stay?<br>

<br>
We can do the cliché, I'll buy a bouquet<br>
Sit down at cafés, make out in the rain<br>
It might not ever be the same, but I'm down for the game, I'm down for the game<br>

<br>
Uh, I'm down for the game<br>
You play with me once, you play with me twice, too much<br>
You play with me once, you play with me twice, too much<br>
You play with me once, you play with me twice, too much<br>

<br>
I had a dream last night, in the dream I said "I love you" for the first time<br>
I hope it's alright (Ooh)<br>
Yeah, I'm fine<br>
Chainsmokin', heart broken open (Oh no)<br>
Can't say I own it if I stole it (Oh no)<br>
Clothes soaking, heart racing open (Oh no)<br>
Can't say I know you in this moment (Oh no)<br>
